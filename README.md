## Assessments

This repo contains a set of assessments that we use to evaluate candidates who want to work with us at DataScience.
In each folder, there is a set of questions and database schema.

When taking a test, we'll send you some connection instructions to a remote MySQL database. Feel free to refer to the [MySQL reference manual](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/) while working through the tests.

The `futurehome` test contains data from a fictional company that produces futuristic home automation products.

The `bikeshare` test contains data about bikeshare rides and stations, open-sourced by [Hubway](http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/), a bikeshare company in Boston.

The `employees` test contains data about a fictional company and its organizational structure.
